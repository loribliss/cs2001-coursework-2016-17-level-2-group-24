Hi,

If everyone uploads there java code/ xml they have done over christmas into the FoodManagement project Fankie has uploaded.
Put your code into the correct files that have already been created.
Before you do this ensure you have anroid SDK platform 23 for the sync gradle to be able to work.
Once we have all done this the everyones work will be in the same project and we can start linking pages and testing.

:)
